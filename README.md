# Shelter
## About the project
The project is two pages with information about shelter for homeless animals. On the main page user can see information about the shelter for animals, cards with pets, who are looking for a house, ways how to help the shelter. The main page is [here](https://ekaterinamash.github.io/Shelter/pages/main/index.html). On the [other page](https://ekaterinamash.github.io/Shelter/pages/pets/index.html) user can see more pet cards than on the main page. Both pages have the same navigation menu and footer with contacts and location of the shelter.
